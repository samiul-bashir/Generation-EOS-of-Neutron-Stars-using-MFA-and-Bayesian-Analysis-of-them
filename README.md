# Generation-EOS-of-Neutron-Stars-using-MFA-and-Bayesian-Analysis-of-them
---
Here, we generate Equation of State of dense matter describing Neutron Stars, using Quantum Hydrodynamics(QHD) and Mean Field Approximation(MFA), create the Mass-Radius Curves of them and get the best fit parameters for the respective observation using Bayesian Analysis.

Most of the mathematics of these codes is inspired from **An Undergraduate Approach to the Quantum Hadrodynamics and the Physics of Neutron Stars** by *Luiz L. Lopes*;  arXiv:2508.16789v1

### We will be using natural units, G=C=h=1

## Free Neutron EOS
We will start with a free Neutron EOS
