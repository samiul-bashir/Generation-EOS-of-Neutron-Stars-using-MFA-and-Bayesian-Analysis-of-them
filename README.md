# Generation-EOS-of-Neutron-Stars-using-MFA-and-Bayesian-Analysis-of-them
Here, we generate Equation of State of dense matter describing Neutron Stars, using Quantum Hydrodynamics(QHD) and Mean Field Approximation(MFA), create the Mass-Radius Curves of them and get the best fit parameters for the respective observation using Bayesian Analysis.
